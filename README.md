# Maven Market Dashboard

## Description
The Maven Market dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales, profit, returns, and customer insights using two years of data from 1997 and 1998. The dashboard is designed to support weekly analysis, enabling stakeholders to explore key performance metrics across various dimensions, including products, customers, and stores. The data has been meticulously cleaned and prepared for analysis, with a focus on ensuring high data quality and accuracy.

### Key Features:
- **Two-Year Data Analysis**: Analyze data across 1997 and 1998, with weekly breakdowns of total transactions, revenue, profit, returns, and more.
- **ETL Process**: Data cleaning and transformation were performed using CSV imports, with transactions imported as a folder. Calendar elements like year, quarter, month, start of month, and start of the week were extracted to enable detailed analysis.
- **Customer Data Preparation**: The customer file was enhanced by merging first and last names into a full name column for identifying top customers. A conditional column was created to determine whether a customer is a parent, based on the presence of children.
- **Data Quality and Data Types**: All data files were thoroughly checked for column quality and data types before loading, ensuring accurate ETL processes.
- **Data Modeling**: A snowflake schema was implemented in the model view, connecting all relevant tables. A snapshot of this model is included in the dashboard.
